### Last Week

#### Dev

I made good progress on a long-standing goal to formalize some the development process around our reporting work. I created an MVP version of a framework to mock and test our SQL queries that are deployed to BigQuery. There are still quite a few rough edges, among them:

- make the mocking process less repetitive
- deploy changes with CI
- better documentation

Also made progress on some new data-integrations requested by Marketing.

#### Home

I've been trying to help our lawn recover from an [army worm] invasion after hurricane season last year. I seeded and fertilized and have been soaking the affected areas daily. No great results to speak of yet, but fingers crossed.

#### Play

- got a couple bike rides in
- exercised pretty consistently
- even got in some body-boarding (albeit on tiny waves that could barely push me)

### Next Week

#### Dev

I will be working primarily on the data-integrations I spoke of above to recognize revenue for one of our projects.

#### Home

For the grass:
- continue soaking affected areas
- add the extra bags of Bermuda seed and fertilizer

#### Play

In order to fix my road bike, I need to order a bike work stand. These are a bit more pricey than I would like, but I'll get plenty of use going forward.
