I have a problem. I have posted **two entries** to my blog in the **six years**. There is simply **too much friction** and a **focus on the wrong things** for me to post content in any kind of regular cadence. But I would like to change. I would like to **Make my Blog Go Again!**

So, what is problem? What has kept me from posting? I think it distills down to two main reasons.

> 1) As a developer, I find myself spending more time tweaking the code behind my blog than I do contributing any content.

I understand why. Writing code is what I do and I have fun doing it. But if I want to actually change my ways and start contributing content I need to keep myself from wanting to play with the guts of the site and keep my focus on posting actual content.

> 2) I never post anything because I never think I have anything useful to say, and even when I think I might have something useful to say, I don't want to post it until it's polished.

I understand this as well, but I think I need to fix it. I want to change! So... What am I going to get this thing going and actually start compiling content.

First, I am going to set a goal of writing at least once a weak. At a minimum just a jot of my high-level goals for that week, or a bit of a recap. Just something to get some momentum. And I'm not going to worry about whether it is good or not - you can't dance unless you start moving.

Second, and _in parallel_ with my first commitment of immediately creating content, I will start a **small** rewrite of the bones of this site. I will use [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) because I am relatively familiar with it, it provides a simple way to [export to a static site](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export), while still giving me the flexibility to do more complicated things if I need to in the future. I will also aim to keep the styling _stupid simple_ and avoid [bikeshedding](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding) over things outside of my wheelhouse.

_Here we go!_
